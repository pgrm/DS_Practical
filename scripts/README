Examples of use of ./start.sh 
(arguments are explained only on its first appearance)

1) Phase 1
java -cp ../bin recipesService.Server --phase1
(run it from scripts folder)
Use the menu to introduce a recipe and check if Log and TimestampVector data structures are correct.

./start.sh 20000 --phase1
(run it from scripts folder)
Executes Log and TimestampVector with a predefined set of users and operations and compares it with a Log and TimestampVector previously calculated.

2) Phases 2
./start.sh 20000 3 --menu –nopurge
Runs 3 Servers and a TestServer locally.
$1: listening port for the TestServer 
$2: number of Servers to be instantiated 
--menu: runs in menu mode. (without --menu argument, it will run in simulated mode, i.e. user activity (add recipes) and dynamism (connections and disconnections) will be automatically generated.
--nopurge: Log is not purged.

./start.sh 20000 15 --logResults --nopurge --noremove
Runs 15 Servers and a TestServer locally.
User activity (add recipes) and dynamism (connections and disconnections) is automatically generated.
Results will be stored in a file named as the groupId from config.properties file (on current path).
--logResults: log results in the following two files:
	<groupXX>: log of all executions and the result for each of them.
	<groupXX>.data:
		in the case that all solutions are equal, contains the final state of data structures.
		in the case that NOT all solutions are equal, contains the first two found solutions that were different.
	(<groupXX> is the value of groupId property in config.properties file (scripts folder))
--nopurge: Log is not purged.
--noremove: no remove operations are issued.

./start.sh 20000 15 --logResults -path ../results --nopurge --noremove
-path <path>: result files are created in ../results folder. If no -path is specified (as in previous example) files will be stored in current folder.

3) Phases 3
./start.sh 20000 3 --logResults -path ../results --menu
Runs 3 Servers and a TestServer locally (and result files are created in ../results folder).
Log is purged.
Menu mode.

./start.sh 20000 15 --logResults -path ../results --noremove
Runs 15 Servers and a TestServer locally (and result files are created in ../results folder).
Log is purged.
Simulated activity and dynamism mode.
No remove operations.

4) Phases 4
In phase 4.1 (extend application adding remove recipe operation), run start.sh script adding --remove argument to test your implementation. For formal evaluation use dslab web.
./start.sh 20000 15 --logResults -path ../results
Runs 15 Servers and a TestServer locally (and result files are created in ../results folder).
Log is purged.
Simulated activity and dynamism mode.
Remove operations are issued.

In phase 4.2 (evaluation of TSAE protocol), modify parameters of config.properties file (scripts folder) to evaluate TSAE protocol under different conditions and environments.
Use runN.sh script to run N times start.sh script. Example:
./runN.sh 10 20000 3 --logResults -path ../results
runs 10 times start.sh script with the following parameters:
	./start.sh 20000 3 --logResults -path ../results 
	Modify activitySimulation class only in case that in phase 4 you want to better understand or modify the modeling of activity and dynamicity (package recipesService.activitySimulation).
